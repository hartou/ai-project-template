# Source Code

This directory contains the main source code for the AI project.

## Structure

- `core/` - Core application logic and utilities
- `ai/` - AI/ML model implementations and interfaces
- `data/` - Data processing and transformation modules
- `services/` - Business logic and service implementations
- `utils/` - Shared utility functions and helpers
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `constants/` - Application constants and configuration
- `hooks/` - Custom hooks and composables
- `middleware/` - Application middleware
- `validators/` - Input validation schemas and functions

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Scalable**: Organized structure for growing projects
- **Testable**: Well-structured code for easy testing
- **Reusable**: Shared components and utilities

## Code Organization

### Core (`core/`)
Essential application functionality and base classes.

### AI/ML (`ai/`)
Machine learning models, training scripts, and inference engines.

### Data Processing (`data/`)
Data ingestion, transformation, and validation modules.

### Services (`services/`)
Business logic layer that orchestrates different components.

### Utils (`utils/`)
Helper functions and utilities used across the application.

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow the established folder structure
2. Use TypeScript for type safety
3. Write unit tests for critical functions
4. Document complex logic with JSDoc comments
5. Follow consistent naming conventions
