# Archive

This directory contains archived files, deprecated code, and historical project artifacts.

## Purpose

The archive serves as a repository for:
- Deprecated features and code
- Old documentation versions
- Experimental implementations
- Legacy configurations
- Backup files
- Historical project artifacts

## Structure

- `deprecated/` - Deprecated features and code
- `experiments/` - Experimental features and prototypes
- `legacy/` - Legacy system components
- `backups/` - Backup files and configurations
- `versions/` - Historical versions of key files
- `docs/` - Archived documentation

## Archive Policy

### What to Archive
- **Deprecated Features**: Code that's no longer used but may be referenced
- **Experimental Code**: Prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- **Legacy Systems**: Old implementations kept for reference
- **Documentation**: Previous versions of important docs
- **Configurations**: Historical config files

### When to Archive
- Before major refactoring or rewrites
- When removing deprecated features
- During version upgrades
- When experimental features are abandoned
- Before significant architectural changes

### Retention Policy
- **Recent Archives**: Keep for 2 years minimum
- **Major Versions**: Keep indefinitely
- **Experimental**: Review and clean up annually
- **Backups**: Follow organizational backup policies
- **Documentation**: Maintain key historical versions

## Usage Guidelines

### Adding to Archive
1. **Document the reason**: Why is this being archived?
2. **Add metadata**: Date, version, responsible team
3. **Update index**: Maintain archive inventory
4. **Clean references**: Remove or update links

### Accessing Archives
- Use version control to track when items were archived
- Maintain an archive index with descriptions
- Document dependencies and relationships
- Include restoration instructions if needed

### Archive Metadata
Each archived item should include:
- **Date archived**: When it was moved to archive
- **Reason**: Why it was archived
- **Dependencies**: What other components it relied on
- **Replacement**: What replaced it (if applicable)
- **Restoration**: How to restore if needed

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Review and clean archives periodically
2. **Documentation**: Document what's archived and why
3. **Compression**: Compress large archived files
4. **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive archived data
5. **Backup**: Include archives in backup strategies
6. **Metadata**: Maintain clear metadata for all archived items

## Recovery Process

If you need to restore something from the archive:

1. Check the archive index for location and metadata
2. Review dependencies and compatibility
3. Test in isolated environment first
4. Update any outdated configurations
5. Document the restoration process
